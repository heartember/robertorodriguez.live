            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li><strong>Personal:</strong> self-awareness, growth, and care.</li>
              <li><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> communication, conflict transformation, relationship-building.</li>
              <li><strong>Systemic:</strong> understanding and shifting social and institutional dynamics.</li>
              <li><strong>Transpersonal:</strong> connecting to shared meaning, ritual, ancestral memory, and the living world.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This integrated approach moves beyond quick fixes, building real depth, resilience, and capacity for change.</p>

              <div class="dimension">
                <h4>The Dreaming Body <span class="dimension-subtitle">(Inner Work & Healing)</span></h4>
                <p>This is the realm of inner life—body, psyche, and personal history. Here we explore beliefs, patterns, nervous-system states, and personal traumas, while nurturing your deepest longings and gifts.</p>
                <p>My coaching supports you to work compassionately with your internal systems so you can align your actions and practices with your most life-affirming values and goals.</p>

              <div class="dimension">
                <h4>The Space Between Us <span class="dimension-subtitle">(Relational Practice)</span></h4>
                <p>This is the field of relationship—where we meet friends, family, colleagues, and communities. Here, we practice the art of connection: finding common ground, collaborating, celebrating, and navigating conflict.</p>
                <p>My coaching and consulting help individuals, couples, groups, and organizations identify the influences shaping their dynamics and build more generative, collaborative ways of working together.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="dimension">
                <h4>The Liberation Promise <span class="dimension-subtitle">(Systems & Social Change)</span></h4>
                <p>This path explores freedom from oppressive patterns while embracing healthier, life-giving alternatives in culture, institutions, and social systems.</p>
                <p>My work supports individuals and organizations to recognize the often-invisible forces that shape our perspectives and behaviors, and to co-create new, liberatory ways of being, relating, and organizing.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="dimension">
                <h4>The Dreaming World <span class="dimension-subtitle">(Non-Ordinary States & Wisdom)</span></h4>
                <p>This is the realm of imagination, altered states, and non-ordinary perceptions—a domain well-known to traditional healers and mystics.</p>
                <p>For individuals, my coaching invites you to pay attention to your own non-linear, non-rational experiences as sources of insight, inspiration, and connection to the wider living world.</p>
                <p>For groups and organizations, I help facilitate shared meaning-making practices, collective rituals, and imaginative approaches that deepen cohesion, cultural grounding, and a sense of purpose beyond the everyday.</p>

              <p>We live in a time that asks much of us—a time when tending to relationships, healing from harm, and cultivating collective care are essential acts of leadership and aliveness.</p>
              <p>This call has shaped the path I walk.</p>
              <p>I grew up amidst physical violence, systemic injustice, and familial disruption. I was a witness to harm, a recipient of it—and, at times, a participant in survival-based patterns I've been actively unlearning, slowly and steadily, ever since. These early experiences taught me about power, resilience, and the deep cost of disconnection.</p>
              <p>
                And over time, I encountered other ways of living.<br>
                Mentors, movements, and lineages showed me what repair could look like. I was invited into community, into ritual, into embodied practice. I learned to listen more deeply—to the land, to conflict, to the wisdom carried in our bodies and stories.
              </p>
              <p><strong>This is the ground my work stands on.</strong></p>
              <p>I support people navigating the complexities of human relationship—internally, interpersonally, and within the systems we live inside. I believe that reaching true adulthood means taking responsibility for the ways we show up in the world: how we wield power, how we relate to one another, how we contribute to collective thriving.</p>
              <p>
                My commitment is to support the pursuit of <strong>Relational Wholeness</strong>:<br>
                To foster awareness, health, and repair through meaningful engagement and service—with each other, and with the more-than-human world that holds us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I bring tools, frameworks, skills, and wisdom passed down by my teachers, my ancestors, and my lived experience.<br>
                And I hold a deep belief:<br>
                Each of us carries a vital contribution—something essential to the well-being of the interconnected systems we belong to, that nourish us, and that we in turn nourish.
              </p>

              <h4>Processwork Student-Practitioner</h4>
              <p>I'm actively training in Process-oriented Psychology (Processwork), a depth approach that integrates somatic, transpersonal, and systemic perspectives. Processwork extends dream analysis to body experiences and applies psychology to world issues including diversity, social conflict, and leadership.</p>

              <h4>Educator</h4>
              <p>My passion for teaching began at 16 as a martial arts instructor. Since then, I've taught English, Spanish, martial arts, and dance to students of all ages, in the U.S. and internationally. Today, learning and teaching remain central to my life and work.</p>

            <div class="experience">
              <h4>Facilitator</h4>
              <p>By my late 20s, I focused on interpersonal communication, group facilitation, and conflict mediation. Encouraged by mentors and communities, I've spent years honing these skills and now offer facilitation and mediation to diverse groups.</p>

            <div class="experience">
              <h4>Embodiment Coach</h4>
              <p>Decades of martial arts, dance, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong inform my approach. I integrate these practices with Processwork's Dreambody work to support clients' embodied awareness and development.</p>

            <div class="experience">
              <h4>Bridge-builder and Liberation Agent</h4>
              <p>Raised in a working-class Latino family in NYC, I learned early to navigate cultural, racial, and class divides. This experience informs my commitment to helping communities build bridges across differences. I'm a founding team member of The Affinity-Belonging Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to social integration and liberation, and I lead workshops on conflict transformation and community-building.</p>
